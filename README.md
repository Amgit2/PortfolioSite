# Portfolio Site

This is my first attempt at making a website. 

Having had no prior experience with HTML, CSS or Typescript it was quite the experience. Spent weeks trying to learn the basics of HTML & CSS and understanding how they interact with each other, as well as learning how the Angular framework ties into it. It was a long, grueling and frustrating process. But it was defintely worth it because it gave me a solid foundation in the basics of HTML, CSS and how to use Angular framework for other larger websites that I have been working on.
