# Portfolio Site

This is my first attempt at making a website. Having had no prior experience with HTML, CSS or Typescript it was quite the experience. Spent weeks trying to correct the positioning of components. But it was defintely worth it because it gave me a solid foundation in the basics of HTML, CSS and how to use Angular framework for other larger websites.
